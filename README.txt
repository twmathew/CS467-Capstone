# CS467-Capstone

For the program Capstone project, collaborated with Gabriel Orellana and Steven Ha to create a tower-defense game.
Live game can be played at: http://people.oregonstate.edu/~has/NoDroneZone/

The game was built with Unity, a game-design program.
Scripts were written in C#. Assets were created using tools like Powerpoint, MS Paint etc.
